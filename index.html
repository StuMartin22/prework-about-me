      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a budding software developer. I originally was on track to become a fisheries biologist but after a few years in the field I realized it wasn't exactly what I wanted to do. My partner and I decided that we should try something new so we packed up and moved across the country for her to start a small business. I got my foot into the door of tecnhology, a field I had wanted to pursue for many years, by becoming a Retail Sales Consultant with AT&T. When the pandemic hit I did the best I could to stay with the company because I loved the job, but it was best for my family to not be in a public workspace during times of covid. I tried a few different small business ideas of my own; flipping and restoring furniture, string crafts, and knit crafts, and while it was enjoyable, I realized that being in tech is still what I wanted to do long term. I then decided to go back to school to go where I've been thinking of going for years! </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I am originally from Owasso, Oklahoma.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Some of my favorite hobbies are puzzles, working on things around the house (carpentry, mechanical, etc), and spending time fishing and in the outdoors.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job is a developer at a company that has fulltime remote availability, or at a minimum, limited office time. Due to COVID-19 the best place for my family is still out of a busy workplace, but if it were the right job, in the right environment, limited interaction would definitely be okay! I would espcially love to be somewhere on the west coast. The pacific northwest would be amazing, but really anywhere west coast would be fantastic. The west coast I know has a lot of potential employers in the field of web/software development and has amazing outdoor opportunities!</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I currently live in Burnville, Minnesota.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I want to be a web developer for a few reasons. The biggest reason is that I've always wanted to do something in the field of technology, but have gone a roundabout way of figuring out which sector I wanted to be in. Secondly, I love doing puzzles and working with my hands. My brother in law is also a developer and I have seen some of the work he does and how he has to work through problems with his colleagues to figure out solutions and it seems like a career that can really satisfy the itch to problem solve! Finally, as I mentioned earlier, the field is looking to currently be transitioning into more remote based work which is perfect for my family and the current state of the world and the global pandemic that we're all currently living through.</p>
